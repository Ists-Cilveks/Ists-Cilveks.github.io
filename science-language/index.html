      <p class="kit-pos-c kit-nice">Okay, so I have an idea for a constructed language that I've been meaning to expand on for years now — at least as early as 2022.</p>
      <p class="kit-neutral">The main goal would be that the texts look like science notation, but really dense and chaotic with, ideally, no written words at all.</p>
      <p class="kit-pos-ootwr vn-take-next">It might look a little like this poem posted on <i lang="tok">ma pona pi toki pona</i>.</p>
      <img src="/science-language/machine.jpg" alt="A poem called 'Machine', with lines about death and God interspersed between dense mathematical notation" class="vn-show-off invert-in-dark-mode">
      <p class="kit-pos-c kit-nice">I'd structure it like a science paper with headings, citations and paragraphs and whatnot but instead of English I'd try to express everything with math notation, programming syntax, chemical equations etc. — all jumbled together.</p>
      <p class="kit-shock">Now, you might be thinking that it wouldn't make any sense — and broadly speaking it wouldn't.</p>
      <p class="kit-annoy">And there are also so many aspects of life that can't be notated scientifically.</p>
      <p class="kit-neutral">But my hope is that the mishmash of ideas would spur readers to interpret the text very loosely and metaphorically.</p>
